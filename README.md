Hi, Myself Sagar Pandit. I'm a Solution Architect by profession with deep interest in technologies like Java, Spring, Spring Boot, Microservices, Kuberentes, Docker, AWS. 
Before becoming a Solution Architect I was working as a technical lead. I have worked with several MNC's till date. I like to work on solution architecture for various applications
specifically with Cloud related. I also implement various POCs locally in order to learn on new technologies.
